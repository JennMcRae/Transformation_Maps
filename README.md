## About The Project

The goal of this project is to collate and analyze pre-existing frameworks of transformation from a wide range of disciplinesâ€”from psychology and organizational change to mythology and Indigenous wisdom traditions. By finding the common patterns and compelling ideas across these models, this tool provides a rich, interactive database and a new, synthesized "Meridian Map" for practical application.

The application is built to be an intuitive and visually engaging resource, making complex theories accessible and easy to navigate.
