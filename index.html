    <!-- Chosen Palette: Softened Teal & Ochre (based on user-provided image) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured into three main, navigable sections: 1. **Explorer Dashboard**: A central hub for filtering and comparing all models in an interactive table format, complemented by a dynamic chart visualizing the distribution of models across disciplines. This design allows for high-level comparison and quick access to details. 2. **Thematic Deep Dives**: A section dedicated to the report's analytical content, presenting the "Nature of Transformation" and "Universal Patterns" in a clear, narrative format with interactive diagrams. This separates analysis from raw data, aiding comprehension. 3. **The Meridian Map**: A dedicated section to visualize and explain the proposed integrated framework, using a structured layout to clearly present its phases and principles. This structure was chosen to guide the user from broad exploration to deep analysis and finally to a practical, synthesized application, mirroring a logical learning journey. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - **Model Database (Explorer Dashboard)**: Report Info -> Summary Table. Goal -> Compare, Filter, Explore. Viz -> Interactive HTML table with JS filtering/searching. Interaction -> Dropdown filters for Discipline/Tradition and text search. Justification -> Allows users to quickly find and compare relevant models based on their specific needs, far more dynamic than a static table.
        - **Discipline Distribution (Explorer Dashboard)**: Report Info -> Model Disciplines. Goal -> Show composition of the dataset. Viz -> Doughnut Chart (Chart.js). Interaction -> Hover for tooltips. Justification -> Provides an immediate visual summary of the intellectual landscape covered in the report.
        - **Universal Patterns (Thematic Deep Dives)**: Report Info -> Section 6 Analysis. Goal -> Explain the archetypal 3-act structure. Viz -> Structured HTML/CSS diagram. Interaction -> Hover effects to highlight stages. Justification -> A visual, non-chart representation makes this abstract concept more concrete and easier to follow than plain text.
        - **The Meridian Map (Meridian Map Section)**: Report Info -> Section 9 Framework. Goal -> Clearly present the proposed integrated model. Viz -> HTML/CSS grid layout. Interaction -> None needed, clarity is key. Justification -> A clean, structured layout is the most effective way to present this new, multi-part framework without distraction.
